1.Where is the entry point specified, and what is its value?
	in the elf_header under	e_entry. its value is 0x80482e0

2.How many sections are there in a.out?
	we can see the number of sections in the elf header under e_shnum.
	in a.out there are 33 = 34-1 (the section at index zero in allways null).

3.What is the size of the .text section?
	we can locate the size of a section in the section headrs table 
	under the sectction headers sh_size enty.
	in a.out the .text section occupies 0001b8H = 440 bytes.

4.Does the symbol _start occur in the file? If so, where is it mapped to in virtual memory?
	in a.out there is a _start symbol under the .text section (index 12)
	and the function_virtual_address can be found in the symbols header st_value entry.
	function_virtual_address = 080482e0H,

5.Does the symbol main occur in the file? If so, where is it mapped to in virtual memory?
	in a.out there is a main symbol under the .text section (index 12)
	function_virtual_address = 08048388H,
	
6.Where in the file does the code of function "main" start?
	symbols can be located in the symbol table.
	and we can find what is there offset inside the elf file by using the following formula:
	symbol_file_offset = section_file_offset + function_virtual_address - section_virtual_address.	
	where the enclosing section inder (in the section headrs table) can be found under the symbols st_shndx
	section_file_offset can be found in the section headers table at index st_shndx
	under sh_offset entry in this section header.
	the section_virtual_address sh_addr entry under the same section header.
	and the function_virtual_address can be found in the symbols st_value entry.
	
	its section_file_offset = 0002e0H,
	section_virtual_address = 080482e0H,
	function_virtual_address = 08048388H,
	there for its offset in the elf file is 0002e0H + 08048388H - 080482e0H = 000388H = 904.
